Hello Shuai, since this is not an official file, I won't bother translating it into English. Maybe I'll do it after finishing my workday. First, I'll set a couple of rules for you. If you clone a repository inside this one, for the love of God, remove the .git folder. You can do it with 'rm -rf .git', and it's not that difficult. You can check the .git folder within the cloned repository by using 'ls -la' and then delete it. ATTENTION: DO NOT DELETE THE .GIT FOLDER FROM THE MAIN REPOSITORY. If you do, you won't be able to commit, and things may go south. Well, the last part is not true, but the commit part is. Anyway, the more mistakes I see, the more I'll keep updating this file.

Hello, I'm the samu of the future or in your case the past . I'm reporting what I did. I fixed a couple of issues with your loop and left you the task of implementing the 'echo' built-in. If you're not too busy preparing for the exam, give it a shot!
Oh, I almost forgot, all the changes are in my branch. If you want to access them, merge with your branch. Feel free to check them out before merging.
